						<h4>Easy price comparison avoids:</h4>
						<h3>Price Comparison Prevention</h3>
						<ul class="description">
							<li>This pattern involves making it difficult to compare the prices of products.</li>
							<li>Price comparison prevention is problematic because allowing the prices of products to be easily comparable on a shopping website helps users make the best decision for purchases.</li>
							<li>When this pattern is practiced, users that have selected a lower quality item will feel more obligated to purchase it due to how time-consuming it would be to investigate further on whether or not they are truly getting the best deal.</li>
							<li><strong>An example:</strong> the screenshot provided demonstrates price comparison prevention in the form of forcing the user to add their item to the cart before showing them the product's price.</li>
							<li>Another way this pattern manifests itself involves bundling products together to make it harder to determine the unit price.</li>
							<li>The best way to avoid this deceptive pattern is to only use one unit when listing the prices of products on your website, and making these prices easily visible.</li>

						<h4>Charging for things in between steps of the checkout process is:</h4>
						<h3>Sneaking into Basket</h3>
						<ul class="description">
							<li>This pattern is typically used to sell extra products or services to a user.</li>
							<li>Can be done by either automatically adding the extra products to the user's cart at checkout, or by including a checkbox opting in for the product that is automatically left checked.</li>
							<li>The user can be further manipulated into buying this extra product if the process to remove it from their purchases is too time-consuming (Also see <strong>roach motel</strong>).</li>
							<li><strong>An example:</strong> in the provided screenshot, an extra magazine and mug were added to this user's purchases and cannot be removed unless the user returns to their bag.</li>
							<li>To avoid using this pattern but still accomplish its main goal, designers can instead ask the user whether or not they'd like to buy the extra item instead of sneakily forcing them to buy it.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Additionally, if the user ignores the offer, the website should not automatically add the item to the user's purchases.</li>

						<h4 class="separate-row-all">Engaging in privacy zuckering:</h4>
						<h3>Privacy Zuckering</h3>
						<ul class="description">
							<li>Privacy zuckering tricks users into unknowingly sharing more personal information about themselves than they are comfortable with.</li>
							<li>The name of this pattern references how FaceBook's privacy settings were originally hard to control, thus causing users to give away too much of their personal information.</li>
							<li>Presently, this pattern often occurs in the form of the terms and conditions of an online service.</li>
							<li><strong>An example:</strong> the above screenshot shows the terms and privacy policy for Whatsapp. Page one of the terms and conditions does not mention FaceBook and also gives the user the option to agree to the terms without reading them in their entirety. If the user were to agree without reading the next page, they would be unaware that by agreeing to the privacy policy, their account data will be shared with FaceBook to improve the content of the ads they will see when using the service.</li>
							<li>While using personal data to improve advertising may not seem harmful, it can potentially lead to effects such as being denied services like insurance.</li>
							<li>To avoid privacy zuckering:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Make the wording in terms and conditions as concise and easy to understand as possible.</li>
								<li>Make the terms and conditions themselves easy to locate and access.</li>
								<li>Users should be encouraged to read through all of the terms, either through the wording or by making them unable to move on to the next page of the site without reading through the terms and conditions.</li>
								<li>These suggestions are not infallible - making it required to read all the terms and conditions, in particular, will likely lead to the user losing interest in the website - but they do allow for users that do read them to be more likely to finish and understand who their personal data will be shared with.</li>

							<li>Trick questions can use double negatives, or take advantage of certain expectations users have when answering questions.</li>
							<li><strong>An example:</strong> the above screenshot asks a trick question regarding communication preferences by listing the negative response above the positive response, whereas we are used to seeing the positive response be listed first. Thus, a user reading quickly may accidentally consent to sharing their personal data when they didn't want to.</li>

						<h4>Pressuring users to not opt out of something is:</h4>
						<h3>Confirmshaming</h3>

							<li><strong>An example:</strong> in the pop-up above, the option to decline the discount the pop-up offers is worded to sound less appealing, thus pressuring the user into accepting the discount, even if it is unwillingly.</li>
							<li>To avoid confirmshaming:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Prioritize being direct when wording options.</li>
								<li>Test the site with users for feedback.</li>
								<li>Test the site on yourself by reading your options out loud and asking yourself whether or not they sound manipulative.</li>

						<h4>Making opting in for a service easier than opting out creates:</h4>
						<h3>Roach Motels</h3>
						<ul class="description">
							<li>Roach motels make it easy to begin using a service, but makes the opt out process harder and longer.</li>
							<li>This pattern is used to pressure users to continue using a service even when they do want to opt out of it.</li>
							<li><strong>An example:</strong> when purchasing tickets from Livenation, the website will automatically subscribe the user to Rolling Stone magazine during the checkout process unless the user unchecks a box (See also: <strong>Sneak into basket</strong>). If the user does unwillingly become subscribed to the magazine, the opt out process, as screenshotted above, is much more time-consuming, requiring the user to either visit Rolling Stone's website or contact customer service to cancel subscription, and to fill out a form and mail it if they want a rebate.</li>
							<li>Other deceptive patterns can be used to create roach motels as well, such as:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Wording the option to opt out to sound less appealing (See also: <strong>confirmshaming</strong>).</li>
								<li>Designing the opt out button to be harder to find on the page (See also: <strong>misdirection</strong>).</li>
							</ul>
							<li>While it is normal for designers to want users to continue using their service, they nonetheless should not resort to roach motels to achieve this goal. Hence, opt out processes should be simplified as much as possible.</li>

						<h4>Notifying users of the end of a free trial avoids:</h4>
						<h3>Forced Continuity</h3>
						<ul class="description">
							<li>This pattern applies to services that offer a free trial period for the user and, upon the end of the free trial, automatically begins charging the user for the paid version of the service without informing them.</li>
							<li>Upgraded forced continuity adds to this by making it hard for the user to opt out of the automatic renewal.</li>
							<li><strong>An example:</strong> the provided screenshot shows the sign-up for a free trial of Audible, with the text at the bottom revealing that the user will start being charged each month upon the trial ending. Although the user can cancel the trial at any time, if they're not given a reminder that their trial is ending soon, this would still be forced continuity, as Audible would then be taking advantage of the possibility of the user forgetting about their free trial during the thirty day period to make money off of them.</li>
							<li>To avoid forced continuity, always send users a notification when their free trial for a service is close to ending so they can cancel their subscription without being charged.</li>

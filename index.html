						<h3>Price Comparison Prevention</h3>
						<p>Allowing the prices of products to be easily comparable on a shopping website helps users make the best decision for purchases. However, one type of deceptive design involves making it difficult to compare the prices of products. This way, if a user has selected a lower quality item, they will feel more obligated to purchase it due to how time-consuming it would be to investigate further on whether or not they are truly getting the best deal. The screenshot above demonstrates price comparison prevention in the form of forcing the user to add their item to the cart before showing them the product's price. Another way this pattern manifests itself involves bundling products together to make it harder to determine the unit price. Hence, the best way to avoid price comparison prevention is to only use one unit when listing the prices of products on your website, and making these prices easily visible.</p>

					<div class="col-12">
						<h3>Disguised Ads</h3>
						<p>These are advertisements that trick the user into clicking on them by designed to look like another type of content on the website. For example, in the screenshot of Yelp above, there initially appears to be two customer reviews underneath the "See all photos" button, but the little yellow icons in the upper left (That the blue arrow is pointing to) reveals these "reviews" are in fact advertisements.</p>

						<h3>Sneaking into Basket</h3>
						<p>Sneaking into the basket is a design pattern typically used to sell extra products or services to a user. This can be done by either automatically adding the extra products to the user's cart at checkout, or by including a checkbox opting in for the product that is automatically left checked. The user can be further manipulated into buying this extra product if the process to remove it from their purchases is too time-consuming (Also see roach motel). This is the case with the above screenshot, in which an extra magazine and mug were added to this user's purchases and cannot be removed unless the user returns to their bag. To avoid using this pattern but still accomplish its main goal, designers can instead ask the user whether or not they'd like to buy the extra item instead of sneakily forcing them to buy it. Additionally, if the user ignores the offer, the website should not automatically add the item to the user's purchases.</p>

						<h3>Trick Questions</h3>
						<p>This deceptive pattern takes advantage of users who read quickly by wording questions that appear to ask one thing when they are in fact asking another, thus tricking users into giving a desired response. Trick questions can be asked in different ways. They can use double negatives, or they can take advantage of certain expectations users have when answering questions. For example, the above screenshot asks a trick question regarding communication preferences by listing the negative response above the positive response, whereas we are used to seeing the positive response be listed first. Thus, a user reading quickly may accidentally consent to sharing their personal data when they didn't want to.</p>

					<div class="col-12">
						<h3>Confirmshaming</h3>
						<p>When giving your site's users a choice between opting in or out of something, it's important to not guilt-trip or manipulate the user into opting in through your wording. One example can be seen in the Radioshack pop-up above, where the option to decline the discount the pop-up offers is worded to sound less appealing, thus pressuring the user into accepting the discount, even if it is unwillingly. To avoid confirmshaming on your website, some tips include prioritizing being directness when wording options, testing the site with users for feedback, or testing it on yourself, by reading your options out loud and asking yourself whether or not they feel manipulative.</p>

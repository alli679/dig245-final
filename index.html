But when designing the website, itâ€™s important to avoid practices that rely on deception, coercion, or misleading the user to achieve those goals. For this website, you will be placed in the role of a web designer and must identify which patterns would be ethical to follow when designing a website, and which patterns would be deceptive for your user.</p>

						<h4>Easy price comparison:</h4>
						<h3>Price Comparison Prevention</h3>
						<p class="description">Allowing the prices of products to be easily comparable on a shopping website helps users make the best decision for purchases. However, one type of deceptive design involves making it difficult to compare the prices of products. This way, if a user has selected a lower quality item, they will feel more obligated to purchase it due to how time-consuming it would be to investigate further on whether or not they are truly getting the best deal. The screenshot above demonstrates price comparison prevention in the form of forcing the user to add their item to the cart before showing them the product's price. Another way this pattern manifests itself involves bundling products together to make it harder to determine the unit price. Hence, the best way to avoid price comparison prevention is to only use one unit when listing the prices of products on your website, and making these prices easily visible.</p>

						<h4>Make ads on a site obvious:</h4>
						<h3>Disguised Ads</h3>
						<p class="description">These are advertisements that trick the user into clicking on them by designed to look like another type of content on the website. For example, in the screenshot of Yelp above, there initially appears to be two customer reviews underneath the "See all photos" button, but the little yellow icons in the upper left (That the blue arrow is pointing to) reveals these "reviews" are in fact advertisements.</p>

						<h4>Show user alternative options before the option they want:</h4>
						<h3>Misdirection</h3>
						<p class="description">This pattern occurs when designers want to take the user's attention off certain elements of a page by making other elements more noticeable in comparison. For example, this screenshot shows the webpage the user is directed to when attempting to cancel their Amazon Prime membership. The "End Membership" button is located at the bottom of the webpage, with three alternative options being placed on top of this button that the user must scroll past.</p>

					<div class="col-xxl-4 col-xl-12">
						<h4>Charge for things in between steps of the checkout process:</h4>
						<h3>Sneaking into Basket</h3>
						<p class="description">Sneaking into the basket is a design pattern typically used to sell extra products or services to a user. This can be done by either automatically adding the extra products to the user's cart at checkout, or by including a checkbox opting in for the product that is automatically left checked. The user can be further manipulated into buying this extra product if the process to remove it from their purchases is too time-consuming (Also see roach motel). This is the case with the above screenshot, in which an extra magazine and mug were added to this user's purchases and cannot be removed unless the user returns to their bag. To avoid using this pattern but still accomplish its main goal, designers can instead ask the user whether or not they'd like to buy the extra item instead of sneakily forcing them to buy it. Additionally, if the user ignores the offer, the website should not automatically add the item to the user's purchases.</p>

						<h4 class="separate-row-all">Engage in privacy zuckering:</h4>
						<h3>Privacy Zuckering</h3>
						<p class="description">This pattern tricks users into unknowingly sharing more personal information about themselves than they are comfortable with. The name of this pattern references how FaceBook's privacy settings were originally hard to control, thus causing users to give away too much of their personal information. Now, privacy zuckering can often occur in the form of the terms and conditions of an online service. For example, the above screenshot shows the terms and privacy policy for Whatsapp. Page one of the terms and conditions does not mention FaceBook and also gives the user the option to agree to the terms without reading them in their entirety. If the user were to agree without reading the next two pages, they would be unaware that by agreeing to the privacy policy, their account data will be shared with FaceBook to improve the content of the ads they will see when using the service. Although using personal data to improve advertising may not seem particularly harmful, it can potentially lead to effects such as being denied services like insurance. To avoid privacy zuckering, designers should making the wording in terms and conditions as concise and easy to understand as possible, and make them easy to locate and access. Users should also be encouraged to read through all of the terms. This can be done either through the wording or by making them unable to move on to the next page of the site without reading through the terms and conditions. While these suggestions may not be completely infallible - making it required to read all the terms and conditions, in particular, will likely lead to the user losing interest in the website - they do allow for users that do read them to be more likely to finish and understand who their personal data will be shared with.</p>

					<div class="col-xxl-4 col-xl-12">
						<h4>Ask user straightforward questions:</h4>
						<h3>Trick Questions</h3>
						<p class="description">This deceptive pattern takes advantage of users who read quickly by wording questions that appear to ask one thing when they are in fact asking another, thus tricking users into giving a desired response. Trick questions can be asked in different ways. They can use double negatives, or they can take advantage of certain expectations users have when answering questions. For example, the above screenshot asks a trick question regarding communication preferences by listing the negative response above the positive response, whereas we are used to seeing the positive response be listed first. Thus, a user reading quickly may accidentally consent to sharing their personal data when they didn't want to.</p>

					<div class="col-xxl-4 col-xl-12">
						<h4>Pressure user to not opt out of something:</h4>
						<h3>Confirmshaming</h3>
						<p class="description">When giving your site's users a choice between opting in or out of something, it's important to not guilt-trip or manipulate the user into opting in through your wording. One example can be seen in the Radioshack pop-up above, where the option to decline the discount the pop-up offers is worded to sound less appealing, thus pressuring the user into accepting the discount, even if it is unwillingly. To avoid confirmshaming on your website, some tips include prioritizing being directness when wording options, testing the site with users for feedback, or testing it on yourself, by reading your options out loud and asking yourself whether or not they feel manipulative.</p>

						<h4 class="separate-row-all">Make opting in for a service easier than opting out:</h4>
						<h3>Roach Motels</h3>
						<p class="description">This pattern is used by designers to pressure users to continue using a service even if they do want to opt out of it. The pattern accomplishes this by making it easy to begin using the service, but makes the opt out process harder and longer. One example can be found when purchasing tickets from Livenation. The website will automatically subscribe the user to Rolling Stone magazine during the checkout process unless the user unchecks a box (See also: Sneak into basket). If the user does unwillingly become subscribed to the magazine, the opt out process, as screenshotted above, is much more time-consuming, requiring the user to fill out a form and mail it. Other deceptive patterns can be used to create roach motels as well, such as wording the option to opt out to sound less appealing (See also: confirmshaming) or designing the opt out button to be harder to find on the page (See also: misdirection). While it is normal for designers to want users to continue using their service, they nonetheless should not resort to roach motels to achieve this goal. Hence, opt out processes should be simplified as much as possible.</p>

					<div class="col-xxl-4 col-xl-12">
						<h4>Notify users of the end of a free trial:</h4>
						<h3>Forced Continuity</h3>
						<p class="description">Forced continuity applies for services that offer a free trial period for the user and, upon the end of the free trial, automatically begins charging the user for the paid version of the service without informing them. Upgraded forced continuity adds to this by making it hard for the user to opt out of the automatic renewal. The above screenshot shows the sign-up for a free trial of Audible, with the text at the bottom revealing that the user will start being charged each month upon the trial ending. Although the user is allowed to cancel the trial at anytime, if they're not given a reminder that their trial is ending soon, this would nevertheless be an example of forced continuity, as Audible would then be taking advantage of the possibilty of the user forgetting about their free trial during the thirty day period to make money off of them. Therefore, to avoid forced continuity in your design, always send users a notification when their free trial for a service is close to ending so they can cancel their subscription without being charged.</p>

						<h4>Send user's friends invitation messages via user's email:</h4>
						<h3>Friend Spamming</h3>
						<p class="description">In 2015, LinkedIn was involved in a lawsuit, in which one of the main issues was the website asking new users for access to their email contacts. The site then uses this information to spam the user's contacts with invitation emails claiming to be from the user themselves. The screenshot above shows LinkedIn's "Add to Network" page, in which clicking the Add button would cause the aformentioned process, known as "friend spamming" to occur. Spamming a user's contacts under the user's name can negatively impact their relationships with those contacts, and is also illegal under California law, so when emailing a user's contacts, never sign it with the user's own name.</p>
